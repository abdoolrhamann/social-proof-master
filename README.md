📚 What I Learned

I got know that having to make big text for title to appear side by side using div 

Break each profile detail into smaller unit and repeat it as many time as possible 

Got to know more about building a responsive site to fits on all screen size even though it's not that perfect in this project. 

Also thought me the perfect place to use CSS positioning
